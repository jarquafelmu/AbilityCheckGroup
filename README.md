# Ability Check Group

Allows a user to quickly make ability checks with the push of a button.

Supports NPCs by default. The script will attempt to use an NPC ability first before resorting to pulling from the PC side if the NPC version is not configured.

## Commands
* !acg -main: Displays buttons for each of the ability groups
* !acp -str|dex|con|int|wis|cha: returns a list of skill checks or basic checks that can be made using those abilities.
